# The Electric Book workflow

The Electric Book workflow is a process and a set of tools for making high-quality books. Team members can work on a book project together and store their work in the cloud.

With the Electric Book workflow, you store your books in plain text with great version control, and create website versions, ebooks and print editions easily from a single source. At the heart of the workflow is the [Electric Book Jekyll template](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book), which you're looking at now.
